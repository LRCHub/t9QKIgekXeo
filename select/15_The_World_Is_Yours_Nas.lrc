[00:24.44] Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
[00:26.86] To hold the mic i'm throbbin, mechanical movement
[00:29.57] Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
[00:54.57] 
[00:32.39] The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
[00:35.69] The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
[00:36.73] The mind activation, react like i'm facin time like
[00:41.33] Cappy mason with pens i'm embracin
[00:43.98] Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
[01:12.98] 
[00:46.19] Suede timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete
[00:48.70] Whether crusin in a six-cab, or montero jeep
[00:51.80] I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
[00:53.26] I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
[00:57.24] I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
[01:00.66] I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)

[02:08.79] 
[01:38.73] Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul
[01:41.39] The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child
[01:44.35] Dwellin in the rotten apple, you get tackled
[01:46.64] Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
[02:10.64] 
[01:49.58] There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays
[01:51.88] While all the old folks pray, to je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
[01:55.15] Of holy water, odds against nas are slaughter
[01:57.87] Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter
[02:00.76] My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
[02:27.76] 
[02:02.86] Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
[02:06.47] How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
[02:08.83] You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker

[02:42.92] 
[02:54.73] I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
[03:01.52] For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
[03:04.42] Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
[03:06.40] I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
[03:09.11] I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
[03:34.11] 
[03:11.63] Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
[03:14.17] Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
[03:16.65] Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
[03:19.33] And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
[03:23.02] Headed for indiana stabbing women like the phantom
[03:25.88] The crew is lamping big willie style
[03:27.79] Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
[03:30.30] Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
[03:33.33] Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin danes plus the games
[03:36.27] People play, bust the problems of the world today
[03:38.87] "It's yours!"
