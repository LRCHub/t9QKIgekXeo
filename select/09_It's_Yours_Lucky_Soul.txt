I've been standing out here in the
Cold so long that I'm
Just 'bout freezing now
I'm just about freezing now
The one sucker punch it went and
Caught me wrong and I'm
Just 'bout breathing now,
I'm only just breathing now

It all comes back to me, I know
It all comes back to me
But it's yours,
Anything that you ain't
Never got given before
Take it all if you're with me
I've no need for anything more
And I would be on fire
It's me that makes you shy
Just try it one more time
Let me glimmer in your eyes

I've been trying not to tread on
Anybody's toes but I'm
Just so clumsy now
I can't stop falling down
I've got a little secret no one's s'posed to know
But I can't help blurting out
You're all I've got to think about

It all comes back to me
I know it all comes back to me
But it's yours
Anything that you ain't
Never got given before
Take it all if you're with me
I've no need for anything more
And I would be on fire
It's me that makes you shy
Just try it one more time
Let me glimmer in your eyes

But it's yours
It's yours
It's yours
(Etc)
